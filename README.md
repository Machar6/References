## üåê Websites Created from Pre-designed Templates

These websites were created based on graphic designs provided by a designer. I selected and modified existing templates to match the visual style and project requirements, making structural and functional adjustments where needed.

- [Website for Company A](https://example-a.com)
- [Product Landing Page for Brand B](https://example-b.com)
- [Portfolio Template Adaptation](https://example-c.com)

##  Websites with Custom Features (Configurators, Calculators, Request Forms, etc.)

These projects involved implementing various interactive features tailored to the needs of each website.
They include custom-built configurators, price calculators, and advanced request or contact forms.

- [Window Price Calculator Tool](https://example-d.com)
- [Product Configurator for E-shop](https://example-e.com)
- [Custom Quote Generator](https://example-f.com)
